There are no prerequisite libraries for BasicPlay.  Simply type `make'
at the command line to compile the program.  This will create the
`basicplay' executable.  You can then simply run the program from this
directory.  If you wish to install the program more permanently, you
may run `make install' as a superuser.  This will create the following
files:

  /usr/share/man/man1/basicplay.1.gz
  /usr/share/bin/basicplay
  /usr/share/basicplay/*

If you do not wish to install the program this way, you may read the
man page by running `make man'.
